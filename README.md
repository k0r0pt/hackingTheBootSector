# Hacking The Boot Sector

Delving into how the boot sector works. Ramblings and research of a young hacker from 2008.

## History

This article was written in mid 2009, based on research and `hacks` done in the summer of 2008 during the author's semester break. k0r0pt was suppposed to be started as a hacker magazine (heavily inspired by the [Phrack](http://www.phrack.org) magazine). The magazine never came to fruition. So, here's the article, finally published (and open-sourced). We've made it available in these formats:

* [txt](k0r0pt-0x01-Hacking_the_boot_sector.txt) - A format inspired by Phrack. This was the original format in which it was meant to be published.
* [Markdown](HackingTheBootSector.md) - Since we're on github. :)

## Note

The article requires knowledge of x86 Assembler. Even though the registers have been explained as much as could have been, it may be a good idea to go through a quick guide or brush up a little on Assembler.

This was written in 2008, and the author had access to his dad's box of floppy disks. But the program can also be run on flash drives, thumb drives, CDs, [insert your media of choice here], etc. Of course, how you engrave that in your media may be different based on what media you're using. Good luck!
